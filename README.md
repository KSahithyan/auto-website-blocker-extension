## Development

**Note** Yarn is recommended to use as the package manager for this project.
**Note** `web-ext` normally runs the extension on Firefox. I don't know what will happen if you don't have firefox installed on your machine.

1. Install dependencies using `yarn install`
2. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
3. Run `yarn run dev` to start the webpack bundling, and also run the extension on Firefox.
